I've been laying here for a while now. 
I can't remember exactly what day it is anymore.

You'd think the constant beeping from the machine would be annoying, but at times like these, it's a relief to know I'm still alive.
After all, if it ever stops, it means my heart have stopped beating.

Ah, the smell of flowers. I wonder what kind of flowers they are. 
Well, I'm not exactly a botanist, so I'd have to read the label. I'm too tired to move.

It's so clean in here. 
The walls are all white and it's all so sterile looking. 
It's not cozy like home, but I'm not here to be cozy, I'm here to heal.

I never knew there was so much crap on TV. Being here with nothing else to do has taught me that atleast.

I really wouldn't mind a coke right now.
Someone must have visited me while I slept. Those are not exactly my favorite magazines.

I'm tired.

The sun's starting to set...
